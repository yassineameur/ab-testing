P.A.T.T stands for pumpkin's Ab Testing Tool.
As its name suggests, this project is an internal tool for ab testing. it is composed of:
- Web app where the user (marketing or products team member) can login and build a test. The user can watch also the results of his built tests in real time.
- A worker that, each time, parses the current tests and compute results (so that it will be shown to the final user via the web app)

### Technical stack
Datalake uses python 3.7 as a programming language. 
For data storage, Postgres is the used database system.
For web app, we have opted to Flask (so easy ann quick to use)
